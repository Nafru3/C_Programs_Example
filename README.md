# C Programs Example  

This project contains several C programming exercises, each illustrating fundamental concepts of the language. Below is a description of each source file included in this project.  

## Source Files  

- **binaire.c**: Implementation of a decimal-to-binary conversion. This exercise reinforces the understanding of bitwise operations.  

- **chaine.c**: String manipulation, including operations such as concatenation, comparison, and substring search.  

- **chercher2.c**: A program that searches for an element in an array using a specific method, illustrating search techniques in C.  

- **client.c**: Implementation of a network client using sockets to communicate with a server. This exercise introduces network programming concepts in C.  

- **fibonacci.c**: Calculation of the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number, demonstrating the use of loops and recursion.  

- **fichier.c**: File handling in C, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files, to understand input/output operations.  

- **grand_petit.c**: A program that identifies the largest and smallest numbers in a given array, illustrating array traversal techniques.  

- **pyramide.c**: Displays a pyramid of characters or numbers on the screen, applying nested loops and output formatting.  

- **recherche_dichotomique.c**: Implementation of the binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.  

- **serveur.c**: Implementation of a network server using sockets to communicate with clients, complementing `client.c`.  

- **tableauptr.c**: Use of pointers to manipulate arrays, illustrating the relationship between pointers and arrays in C.  

- **tri.c**: Implementation of sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort or bubble sort, to organize array elements.  

## Learning Objectives  

This project aims to:  

- Familiarize with C syntax and control structures.  
- Understand memory management, including pointer usage.  
- Learn string and file manipulation techniques.  
- Introduce network programming concepts with sockets.  
- Implement classic search and sorting algorithms.  

## Compilation and Execution  

To compile and run these programs, use a C compiler such as GCC. For example, to compile and execute `binaire.c`:  

```bash
gcc -o binaire binaire.c
./binaire
```

Repeat these steps for each source file by replacing `binaire` and `binaire.c` with the appropriate names.
